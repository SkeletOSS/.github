## SkeletOSS

SkeletOSS, short for Skeletós Open Source Software, is an organization that aims to provide the tools programmers need to learn and implement complex software in the field of systems programming.

## Projects

### SkeletOS

A work in progress skeleton operating system. The goal is to provide a modern tooling, testing, and best practices framework around which learners can build a completely functional operating system in a series of discrete steps.

## Naming

SkeletOSS, and the SkeletOS operating system project, is based on the Greek word skeletós (skeleton). All of the repositories are skeletons that provide the information and tooling foundation upon which users may build as many layers of robust engineering as they wish.
