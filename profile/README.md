## SkeletOSS

SkeletOSS, short for Skeletos Open Source Software, is an organization that aims to provide the tools programmers need to learn and implement complex software in the operating systems, networking, and compiler fields. Below you will find the projects currently available to users.

## Projects

### SkeletOS

A work in progress skeleton operating system. The goal is to provide a modern tooling, testing, and best practices framework around which learners can build a completely functional operating system in a series of discrete steps.

## Naming

SkeletOSS, and the SkeletOS operating system project, is based on the Greek word skelet√≥s (skeleton). All of the repositories are skeletons that provide the information and tooling users need to implement as many layers of robust engineering as they wish.
